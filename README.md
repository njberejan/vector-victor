# Vector-Victor

This repository is for the Vector-Victor assignment from The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

This assignment was our first introduction to testing through nosetests. The object was to build code in the linear_algebra files in such a way that each function would pass the respective pre-built and provided test function in the linear_algebra_tests.py file.

Note: This assignment needs to be touched up to ensure it is completed in full.
